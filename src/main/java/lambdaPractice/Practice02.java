        //Example 1: Type the code that prints the list elements on the same line with a space between them.

        //Example 2: Type the code that prints the list elements on the same line without repetition, with a space between them.

        //Example 3: Type the code that prints the character numbers of the list elements on the same line with a space
        //between them.

        //Example 4: Type the code that prints the list elements with the odd number of characters on the same line without
        //repetition, with a space between them.

        //Example 5: Type the code that prints the list elements in uppercase letters on the same line without repetition,
        //with a space between them.

        //Example 6: Type the code that prints the list elements whose first letter is 'a' or 'p' on the same line without
        //repetition, with a space between them.

        //Example 7: Type the code that prints the list elements whose last letter is 'a' or 'e' on the same line without
        //repetition, with a space between them.

        //Example 8: Type the code that prints the list elements by adding asterisks at the beginning and end.

        //Example 9: Type the code that sorts the list elements from largest to smallest according to the number of characters.

        //Example 10: Type the code that sorts the list elements with the even number of characters from largest to smallest
        //according to the number of characters.
